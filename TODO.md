## UI/UX Redesign

### 4. Comprehensive Theme & Look-and-Feel Refresh
- [ ] Move away from dark purple theme
- [ ] Evaluate: Light + Indigo/Blue (professional, modern, trustworthy)
- [ ] Review typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy
- [ ] Consider light mode as default (easier to read for resume work)
- [ ] Ensure consistency across all components (modals, buttons, inputs)
- [ ] Add visual polish: shadows, transitions, hover states
- [ ] Reference: GitHub, Linear, Notion for inspiration

## Other Ideas (add as they come up)

- [ ] Export all bullets to markdown/text file
- [ ] Copy all bullets to clipboard with one click
- [ ] Date range filtering (commits from last 6 months, etc.)
- [ ] Sprint-based filtering
